**An online multiplayer adaptation of the classic hit board game Codenames. Allows 4+ players to participate in a game of deduction as two teams race to decode the clues given to them by their spymaster.**
<br/>

**A Brief Description:**
Built with Google Firebase and React to create real-time connectivity across multiple users and to be able to sync up various decks, boards, and roles. One of the interesting things about the project was building the game logic, as we had to take into consideration what data we need available to manipulate and how it would interact with each userâ€™s unique set of data. We learned how to better tackle the code from a scalability POV as reads and writes to the database can quickly pile up, especially when dealing with multiple users during one game session.
